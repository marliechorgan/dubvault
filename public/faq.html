    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <div class="faq-entry">
      <h2>How do I download tracks?</h2>
      <p>
        You must be logged in with a paid subscription. If you’re not subscribed, 
        head to <a href="/profile.html">My Profile</a> to upgrade. Once subscribed, 
        you can click the “Download” button on any track that hasn’t expired.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-entry">
      <h2>How long are tracks available?</h2>
      <p>
        Each new dub is available for 2 months. After that, it expires 
        and can’t be downloaded. We keep the platform fresh with weekly additions, 
        so there’s always something new.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-entry">
      <h2>How do I cancel my subscription?</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re a paying member, you’ll see a “Cancel Subscription” button on 
        the <a href="/profile.html">My Profile</a> page. In the future, 
        we plan to offer a direct link to the Stripe Billing Portal so 
        you can manage your subscription instantly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-entry">
      <h2>Is it really £20/month?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. We’re priced at £20/month to ensure fair compensation for producers 
        (we pay £200/track) and to keep the platform sustainable while growing toward 
        our goal of 50,000 members by Year 2.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-entry">
      <h2>Can I share the dubs with my friends?</h2>
      <p>
        We encourage you to DJ and play the tracks at events, but we ask you 
        not to distribute them outside of DubVault. Each file is watermarked, 
        and we rely on your integrity to support our producers and the UK underground scene.
