    <h1>About DubVault</h1>
    <p>DubVault is the heart of underground dance music. We empower independent producers, give top DJs exclusive access to fresh tracks, and nurture a community built on genuine passion.</p>
    <p>Our artist-first philosophy ensures that creators receive fair compensation and maintain full ownership of their work. Tracks rise organically through community votes—not algorithms—ensuring that quality and authenticity prevail.</p>
    <p>We also celebrate the rich history of genres like Drum & Bass, Speed Garage, and House, preserving their essence in every release.</p>
