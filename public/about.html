      <p class="slide-in-left" style="margin-bottom:2rem;">
        DubVault embodies a mission to empower the UK’s underground dance scene—Drum &amp; Bass,
        Speed Garage, and House—while circumventing mainstream platforms that rely on virality.
        We believe the underground should belong to the people, not algorithms.

          <h2 class="pulse">Our Vision</h2>
          <p>DubVault's a war machine for the underground: empowering indie producers, arming DJs with exclusive cuts, and hooking fans into a raw ecosystem free from mainstream sludge. Profits are necessary, but not at the cost of culture—control goes back to the community.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-card slide-in-right glitch-hover">
          <h2 class="pulse">Our Mission</h2>
          <p>One platform, no compromise: producers cash out fairly with £25–£50 upfront plus revenue shares, DJs secure exclusive bangers, and fans steer the ship with votes—no algorithms that only care about going viral. We're scaling quickly and keeping it authentic.</p>
        </div>

          <p>Artists: instant pay, keep your rights, six-month exclusivity, real promo with Q&amp;As and remix contests. Fans: vote tracks up, earn DubPoints, snag merch, and shape the scene. DJs: fresh cuts you won’t find elsewhere. We’re removing the middleman, so true talent rises.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-card slide-in-right glitch-hover">
          <h2 class="pulse">Our Strategy</h2>
          <p>Year 1: £171K profit, 2K subs. Year 2: £513K, merch and workshops join the mix. Year 3: £1.1M, licensing marketplace emerges. We harness real-world word-of-mouth, local clubs, and authentic artistry. By bypassing cookie-cutter algorithms, we’re forging a direct path for underground music to thrive.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="slide-in-left" style="margin-top:2rem;">
        We’re filling a gap in the market for raw, grassroots control—no mainstream constraints,
        no faceless corporate filters. The underground belongs to everyone who truly cares about
        the sound, and DubVault is here to let the people decide.
