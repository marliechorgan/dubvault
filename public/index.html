          <h3 class="pulse">Our Rebellion</h3>
          <p>DubVault’s a middle finger to the mainstream—built to pump indie producers with cash and power, delivering Drum &amp; Bass, Speed Garage, and House that hits raw. We stand in direct opposition to soulless streaming giants that reduce everything to viral potential.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-card slide-in-right glitch-hover">
          <h3 class="pulse">Why We Grind</h3>
          <p>Big platforms starve artists and bury tracks under algorithms. We flip it—upfront pay, real revenue cuts, and fan votes that let the streets rule. We address a serious gap in the market for niche, authentic music, ungoverned by data-driven formulas.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-card slide-in-left glitch-hover">
          <h3 class="pulse">Our Code</h3>
          <p>Artists keep their soul and cash. Culture stays untamed—no sellout beats. Fans call the shots, torching trash and lifting fire. We exist to connect real heads who crave real music, fostering a powerful community that shapes its own destiny.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-card slide-in-right glitch-hover">
          <h3 class="pulse">Next Level</h3>
          <p>Web-app drops Q3 2025 for offline chaos, vinyl and merch hit 2026, workshops with OGs land Q4 2025. We’re building a fortress for the underground, run by the people, not by a faceless AI whose only interest is going viral.</p>
